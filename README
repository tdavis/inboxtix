OVERVIEW

Inboxtix is a service which sends up-to-the-minute ticket pricing for your
favorite team, artist, or performer right to your inbox.

It also serves as an example of what can be created using the TicketStumbler API.
To that end, we've open-sourced this app so that those interested in building
their own apps on top of TicketStumbler have an example to go by. For more
information on the API, see: http://ticketstumbler.com/api/docs/
