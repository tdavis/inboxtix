OVERVIEW

Seats Tweets is a Twitter service which tweets current ticket prices to upcoming MLB, NBA, and NHL games (with more to come!)

It also serves as an example of what can be created using the TicketStumbler API. To that end, we've open-sourced this app so that those interested in building their own apps on top of TicketStumbler have an example to go by. For more information on the API, see: http://ticketstumbler.com/api/docs/
